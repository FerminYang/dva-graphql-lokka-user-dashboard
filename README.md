## About this project

Mutated from https://github.com/sorrycc/blog/issues/18 tutorial, replaced the original Restful API to GraphQL(https://graph.cool) by using Lokka(https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka#demo-apps).

## How to use

Install dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Start server.

```bash
$ yarn start
```

If success, app will be open in your default browser automatically.
